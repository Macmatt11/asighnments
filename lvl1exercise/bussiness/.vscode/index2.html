                <span class="span">Some History on Diabetes</span> There are two types of Diabetes 
                The first is type 1. Heres what you need to know about type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs at every age and in people of every race, shape, and size.
                In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin. The body breaks down the carbohydrates you eat into blood glucose (blood sugar) that it uses for energy—and insulin is a hormone that the body needs to get glucose from the bloodstream into the cells of the body. With the help of insulin therapy and other treatments, everyone can learn to manage their condition and live long, healthy lives.
                Remember: this is a condition that can be managed. By living a healthy lifestyle filled with exercise and proper diet, you can live a normal life and do everything you set out to do

                The second type is type two.Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes—and it means that your body doesnt use insulin properly. And while some people can control their blood glucose levels with healthy eating and exercise, others may need medication or insulin to help manage it. 
                Regardless, you have options—and we're here with the tools, resources, and support you need.

                <span class="span">Kydney Disease</span> Kidney disease, also called chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a serious condition that affects millions of people in the United States–many of whom do not know they suffer from the disease. If you suffer from CKD, it means that your normal kidney function is no longer working due to damage. This means that your kidneys no longer keep you healthy in the way they used to.
                 While kidney disease symptoms may not be obvious in early stages, it progresses over time and may cause other health issues like heart disease.Kidney disease is considered a “silent disease” and most patients do not have any symptoms until the kidney disease has progressed to a more advanced stage. 
                This is why it is so important for a patient to have regular appointments with a doctor to check labs and screen for kidney disease.

                <span class="span">High Blood Pressure</span>High blood pressure (HBP or hypertension) is when your blood pressure, the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels, is consistently too high.
                To survive and function properly, your tissues and organs need the oxygenated blood that your circulatory system carries throughout the body. When the heart beats, it creates pressure that pushes blood through a network of tube-shaped blood vessels, which include arteries, veins and capillaries. This pressure — blood pressure — is the result of two forces: The first force (systolic pressure) 
                occurs as blood pumps out of the heart and into the arteries that are part of the circulatory system. The second force (diastolic pressure) is created as the heart rests between heart beats. (These two forces are each represented by numbers in a blod pressure test.
