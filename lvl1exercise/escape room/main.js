//Write a game that lets a user escape a room. The character finds him/herself locked in a room. In order to escape the room, your character needs to find
// the key in the room and then open the door. There's also a hole in the wall in the room. If your character puts his hand in the hole, he dies
//Tell the user their options:

//1. Find the key, or
//2. Open the door
  //  1. Put hand in hole
//They can't open the door unless they find the key first.They die if they put their hand in the hole.
